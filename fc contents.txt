Primal-Focused

Extreme Primal fights are contents in FFXIV that prize players with wide range of valuable rewards, 
including high item level weapons, materials for chocobo barding and flashy weapons, exclusive mounts, and more!
In addition, the fights themselves are fun to learn and are cathartic upon clearing.
Extreme Primal fights are the pinnacle of midcore raiding and clearing the newest Extreme Primal fight
is our main goal (Currently Sophia-Ex). This doesn't mean we ignore older primals as they still hold 
considerable value for their crafting mats and mounts!

Get that Gil

With the ability to clear Extreme Primal fights with ease comes the ability to Farm it as a Free Company.
Our market savvy members will find the hottest items in Eorzea, identify the materials to craft it, farm
the materials together, craft it, then sell for shared profit! Profit from one item may not seem like a lot,
but we'll be swimming in gil once we are able to put out multiple items like, Crafted Primal Weapons, 
Replica Dreadwyrm and High Allagan gears, and etc.

FC Events and Daily Activities

We want to host a variety of fun events for ourselves. This includes, FC Weekly Gil Lottery,
Fashion Shows, Map nights, Transformation contest, and etc! Of course, we are always open to your
ideas! In addition, we want to dedicate specific days of the week to run 8 man content together, such as
Raid nights (Sophia Ex / Creator Savage), Alexander loot runs, Void Ark / Weeping City. Schedule and content
will be adjusted according to members' needs.

We want you

We value bringing in a quality member over rapidly increasing the size of our FC.
If you are polite, responsible, punctual, aka a mature player, become a Radiant Royal today!
